            <h1>About Me...</h1>
            <p>
                I'm actively looking out for various internship or full time opportunities, based on my knowledge at :
                UI Design <br> <br>
                .NET framework <br> <br>
                Web Devlepment opportunities <br> <br>
                c++ framework <br> <br>
                I would also like to say that I'm very sincere and strict about my work as I'm not a fast learner but
                more of a realist person. I tend to practise again and again with utmost precision until I make it
                right, thus I might constantly pin the people I'm working with/under, but a promise to deliever the best
                that I'm asked to do. <br> <br>
                All I need is an opportunity for prove self. <br> <br>
